<!-- What I did to make a more accessible Haunted House: -->
<!-- 1) I added alt descriptions to all of my pictures -->
<!-- 2) I used lighter and darker colors in CSS to make them contrast better for people with color blindness-->
<!-- 3) I used a bigger font size for those who have low vision or the elderly-->
<!-- 4) I made sure that all of my pages had an h1 that described the room you were in -->
<!-- 5) I made sure that all of my links had descriptive names which described where in the haunted house they would take you. -->
